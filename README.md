# Router Vulnerability Scan Tool
Tool able to check the security level of a router. Check if the router is vulnerable to DNS rebinding and if there are any known CVEs or exploits.

`Singularity of Origin` is a tool to perform [DNS rebinding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_rebinding) attacks.
It includes the necessary components to rebind the IP address of the attack server DNS name to the target machine's IP address and to serve attack payloads to exploit vulnerable software on the target machine. 

Detailed documentation is on the [wiki pages](https://github.com/nccgroup/singularity/wiki).

## Setup and Installation

### Requirements

* Go version 1.16 or newer.
* A Linux server with public IP address; the server can be obtained from a hosting providers, such as [Linode](https://www.linode.com/), [Amazon AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/), etc.
* A Domain you can buy it from [namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/), [gandi](https://www.gandi.net), etc. You need be able to add and edit your own DNS records for your domain.


### Setup

#### DNS configuration

From the DNS management web interface of the domain registrar from which the domain was purchased, the following DNS records must be added:

* **Type**: "A" **Name**: "rebinder", **IPv4**: "*youripaddress*". 
  This record allows you to access the application also by typing "rebinder.yourdomain".
* **Type**: "NS" **Name**: "dynamic", **IPv4**: "*rebinder.yourdomain*".
  This record allows you to access the application through any subdomain of the type ".dynamic.yourdomain.", For example "foo.dynamic.yourdomain".
* **Type**: "A" **Name**: "*", **IPv4**: "*youripaddress*". 
  This record is required in order to use the browser as a proxy. 

#### Server configuration
The server requires the Go programming language in order to compile and run the application.

##### Install Golang
Follow the instructions from the official [Go Programming Language web site](https://golang.org/doc/install).

##### Obtain Singularity

To download the application you need to clone the repository with the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nccgroup/singularity
````

##### Compile 

```bash
$ cd singularity/cmd/singularity-server
$ go build
````

##### Deploy

 * Deploy the "html" directory in let's say "~/singularity".
 * Deploy the `singularity-server` binary in "~/singularity".

```bash
$ mkdir -p ~/singularity/html
$ cp singularity-server ~/singularity/
$ cp -r ../../html/* ~/singularity/html/
```

##### Run
Change to the newly created directory (e.g. `cd ~/singularity/`) and start `singularity-server` with `sudo ./singularity-server --HTTPServerPort  8080`. This will use a DNS rebinding strategy based on the content of the DNS query by default e.g. `s-ip.ad.dr.ss-127.0.0.1-<random_number>-fs-e.dynamic.your.domain` will return first  "*ip.ad.dr.ss*", the attacker host IP address, then  "127.0.0.1" for subsequent queries for a limited period of time.

Note: You will need to verify that other services do not listen on ports required by Singularity. 

###### Minimum required ports:

- UDP 53 (DNS)
- TCP 8080 (configurable default port for the manager web interface)
- The port where the vulnerable application is running (e.g. port 3000 for the
  Ruby on Rails Web Console or port 9333 for VS Code Chrome DevTools)

On Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, by default, `systemd-resolved` is listening on the localhost UDP port 53. This will prevent Singularity from starting.
Disable `systemd-resolved` with this command: `sudo systemctl disable --now systemd-resolved.service`.
Next, update the file `/etc/resolv.conf` to make sure it does not contain `nameserver 127.0.0.53` but something like `nameserver 8.8.8.8`.
Replace `8.8.8.8` with the IP address of the DNS server of your choosing (e.g. nameserver 169.254.169.254 on [GCP](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/internal-dns)).


##### Firewalls
Singularity requires multiple ports exposed to the Internet (or at least to the
network from which you access the tool via your browser).
The minimum required ports are UDP 53 for DNS and the port where the
Singularity manager web interface is running.
The default port for the manager web interface is TCP port 8080.
Additionally, Singularity requires that the payload is served from the same
port where the vulnerable/exploited application is running on to not violate
the [same-origin policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy).

Minimum required ports are listed [above](#Minimum-required-ports).

Please check with your hosting provider to configure allowed inbound ports:

- [AWS: Authorizing Inbound Traffic for Your Linux Instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/authorizing-access-to-an-instance.html) 
- [GCP: Using Firewall Rules ](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/using-firewalls)


### Testing the Setup

#### On the Victim Host
 * Deploy a local test service with `python -c 'import BaseHTTPServer as bhs, SimpleHTTPServer as shs; bhs.HTTPServer(("127.0.0.1", 8080), shs.SimpleHTTPRequestHandler).serve_forever()'` from a directory containing some test data files, on your client machine.
 * Browse to "http://rebinder.your.domain:8080/manager.html".
 * Ensure that the following fields contain the correct information: 
   * "Attack Host Domain" e.g. "*dynamic.your.domain*"
   * "Attack Host" e.g. "*ip.ad.dr.ss*"
   * "Target Port" e.g. 8080
   * "Attack Payload", "payload-simple-fetch-get.html".
 * Click on "Start Attack".
 * The content of your victim host directory should be displayed within a few seconds/minutes in an alert box.
